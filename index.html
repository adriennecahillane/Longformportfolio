<!--Accessibility considerations
Opening links in a new tab or window can cause accessibility issues. Here are some reasons why: Links opening in a new tab can prove disorienting for people with low vision or are navigating via screen reader, especially when there is no warning. However, using iframe to package content within a modal also raises accessibility concerns-->

           <p><em>1. Consider the role of rhetoric, technology, and ethics in acts of making.</em></p>
              <p>In this class, most of the design tools we use include AI. During the course so far, we have learned and debated the ethical concerns of using AI in our work. AI is embedded in things like open source elements and pre made templates. Even when we aren't trying to use it, AI is everywhere in design. It is surprising to me how helpful technology as a whole can be, especially for people who may not have a creative eye. As the course has progressed, my personal mindset about using AI for design has also changed. I used to have a strongly anti AI mindset and for some classes I avoid it at all costs. However, tools like Photoshop's image generator, can be helpful while creating a project.  </p>

            <p><em>2. Leverage Design Principles.</em></p>
              <p>Our textbook for this class, The Non Designer's Design Book, has been an invaluable resource for me. I think that following the basic design pricniples we learn have given my projects an air of sophistication already. The book discusses everything from colors to typography. Even the simplest trick, like switching from center to left alignment, can make a design look and feel more elevated. I also found techniques like kerning and contrast interesting because I did not have much knowledge of them before. Many of the principles we have learned are also helpful reminders. I already knew the principle of proximity and to group relevant information together. As a beginner student of design, I think it is helpful to have guidlines to follow while creating projects.  </p>

             <p><em>3. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
              <p> In almost every class, we present our work to our classmates. We discuss the weekly readings, show each other our weekly projects and offer insight and feedback. In a class with so much creative work, it is really helpful to hear what other peoples ideas and processes are. I have learned different techniques for Adobe software and gained inspiration for my own designs just by sharing my work. </p>

              <p> In a project based class, our skills are always improving and changing. Sometimes it takes extra effort to make a project look clean and polished. I revised the cartoon project multiple times because I was unfamiliar with the Adobe Indesign pen tool. Revising our projects can help us grow as designers and students. Revising our projects helped prepare me for professional settings and taught me problem solving skills </p>

              <p><em>5. Learn to present your work.</em></p>
              <p> For each project we create, we present it to our peers during class. I enjoyed sharing projects with my peers because they provide helpful feedback. My classmates gave me helpful tips for the cartoon project and the design fuego. There were also occasions where my peers knew a technique that I did not know. Presenting to others seems scary, but its not. Everyone in our class is friendly, talented and good listeners. By presenting in small group environment, the goal is to improve our public speaking skills while simultaneously improve our writing and design skills..</p>

            <p><em>1. Consider the role of rhetoric, technology, and ethics in acts of making.</em></p>
               <p> In the short form portfolio, the focus of our projects was creating items with the intentions of others reading them. For design beginnings, we focused more on building our skillset. When you create something for others to view, you must follow a whole different set of principles. One thing I learned in this class is that rhetoric is everywhere in design. The colors, shapes and fonts in a design can convey all sorts of messages. For example, I chose to style my Graphic Design Resume in green because the color green represents ambition and wealth. The most eye-opening section for me was about accessibility. I found all of the materials about accessibility to be a harsh reality check. One of the readings for this class explained how everyone is closer to being disabled than they might realize. Creators are responsible for ensuring their work benefits and does not exclude its users. It is important to consider which groups could possibly be excluded when designing something.  </p>

     <div class="col-sm-4">
             <p><em>2. Leverage Design Principles.</em></p>
               <p> For this section, I better understood how to apply the good design principles to my work. In the two page spread copy project, I experimented with alignment while replicating the original spread. I found that alternating how the images and text were aligned creates a nice path for the eyes to follow. My favorite design principle to apply is contrast. I believe that using elements of contrast can elevate your design. In my graphic design resume I bolded and italicized certain things, so the reader can easily find them. One strategy that I have used across all of the projects so far is contrasting fonts. Using different fonts to emphasize text is also a rhetorical strategy.  </p>

     <div class="col-sm-4">
              <p><em>3. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
               <p> Our projects have become more substantial and the importance of class workshops is becoming more apparent. For the magazine ad with copy, I created it to appeal to a Gen Z audience. I gained some valuable feedback from my workshop group who were all Gen Z women about how to make the design more appealing to our peers. They liked my overall concept, but suggested I change some of the copy to make it sound more natural. I think the small group is a good environment to share our projects in detail, but there is not a lot of pressure. </p>

               <p><em>4. Practice revision within and across media forms.</em></p>
               <p> I made significant revisions to my two page spread copy. The original magazine spread I chose was diffcult to replicate because it included drawings that were not easy to replicate. I chose a different magazine spread that was a different aesthetic and easier to replicate on my own. I also revised the copy on my magazine advertisement. My group suggested I include some language to attract a Gen Z audience because my original copy sounded boring and flat. Lastly, before I submitted my graphic design resume, I made revisions as well. The first version of my resume included squares in the header with my name. I changed the squares to softer oval shapes because I found the harsh lines of the sqaures to be distracting. Through my revisions, I found that including different shapes in your design can influence the path of where the eyes follow. </p>

               <p><em>5. Learn to present your work.</em></p>
               <p> Personally, I enjoy presenting my work because public speaking comes naturally to me. The only scary part about presenting is comparing yourself to other classmates. I got over that mentality fairly quickly once I realized that everyone has their own tastes, aesthetic and skill sets. Everyone is creating something different and it's interesting to see how their projects come together. Like peer workshops, I have also found inspiration from my peers during presentation time. Lastly, I found that presenting my work throughout this course has made me feel more confident with the design skills I learned. Saying things out loud helps you feel more confident with the information even if you are still learning.  </p>

        <p><em>1. Consider the role of rhetoric, technology, and ethics in acts of making.</em></p>
           <p> In the longer projects, rhetoric becomes more important since we are trying to convey more information. In my 10 page spread, I tried to convey themes of family and Italian culture. I think using design to convey messages can be difficult, especially when there is other information to share. Technology has enhanced magazine production and streamlined the process. I found the magazine spread difficult to accomplish, even with the help of technology. I can't imagine what the process was like before we had computers to do the heavy lifting for us. Is it ethical to create publications with technology even if it means putting people out of jobs? For my client project, I designed a course flyer that will be distributed throughout campus. The final flyer looks nice, but I think it would have looked bad if I designed it by hand. Lastly, for the UX brand design project, I used technology and open source artwork. There are many ethical questions surrounding this concept. Are the artists who provide this art fairly compensated? Designing items like flyers and brand guides are more accessible with these tools, but the ethical value of these tools is still up for debate. </p>
 </div>
 
 <div class="col-sm-4">
         <p><em>2. Leverage Design Principles.</em></p>
           <p> I used the principles of color theory, contrast and proximity the most in these projects. I found it interesting how the design principles present themselves in everyday brands. In my rebrand of Olipop, a functional beverage brand, I used a green and blue color pallette to symbolize wellness and reliability. In my magazine spread, I tried to use image cut outs and other visual elements to create a path for the eyes to follow. I also used fancier fonts for titles in order to add variety and contrast from the body text. In my course flyer for Dr. Marsellas, I grouped different blocks of information in blue rectangles to make certain pieces of information stand out. </p>
 </div>

 <div class="col-sm-4">
          <p><em>3. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
           <p>I found the workshop environment to be most helpful for the branding project. Since most of my group was familiar with the brand, they were able to provide helpful feedback based on their own experiences with the brand. The consensus from the group was that Olipop already has succesful tactics, but their design is not appealing to the 18-24 demographic. For the client design project, we all worked with different kinds of clients. It was helpful to hear their insights even though they weren't working on anything similar. Lastly, I did not find workshopping the magazine helpful. I appreciated my groups feedback and the people I sat near were nice, but executing the concepts in InDesign was difficult. </p>

           <p> Most of my revisions for the long form section were concentrated on the magazine. It took me a long time to reach a submittable version. I struggled with learning InDesign, which resulted in a tedious revision process. I experimented with revising in other mediums as well. I used Adobe express to attempt cutting out photos. Revising across mutiple different applications taught me the importance of keeping an organized workspace. I also learned the importance of paying attention to detail in InDesign. Sometimes, I would move one item and it would mess up the rest of the page. </p>

 <div class="col-sm-4">
           <p><em>5. Learn to present your work.</em></p>
           <p>The most helpful presentation was when we presented our UX brand studies. The presentation groups were different and this group included some people who were unfamiliar with Olipop. Their feedback was valuable because my designs were their first impressions of the brand. I appreciated how the group asked thoughtful questions. I was nervous that I was the first person to present, but felt at ease because we are all learning and completing the same assignment. I appreciated the preesentations because it mimiced something from a professional setting. Marketing professionals often give pitches just like this and have clients in the room asking questions, similar to how our classmates did. </p>
